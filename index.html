<H1>Attributes of a Soccer Player</H1>
<H3>Dave Debreceni</H3>
<P>Since I was taking my son to soccer camp this week to be reviewed by various international and domestic coaches, 
I thought it only fitting to do an analysis of what makes a good player.  Being a coach/player for many years and having 
had the pleasure of working with some very talented players I obviously had my own opinions of what matters in players.  
But I was always curios about the types of attributes that made up top players.  I found a data set on Kaggle that had 
the attributes of many players.  Now these are ratings for the game EA Sports Fifa, but they are consider accurate ratings.</P>

<P>What I am going to review is basic skills.  These are: Crossing, Finishing, Passing, Volleys, Dribbling, and Ball Control.</P>
<h3>Questions</H3>
<UL><LI>Are there certain attributes that are more common in the top end players vs bottom? (approx 10,000 players analyzed)
<LI>In the top 100 ranked players in the world, how do the skills break down?
<LI>Are there certain skills that more desired by position?
<LI>What should coaches focus on when developing players?
<UL>
