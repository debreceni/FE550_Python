						<H1>Attributes of a Soccer Player</H1>
						<H3>Dave Debreceni</H3>
						<P>Since I was taking my son to soccer camp this week to be reviewed by various international and domestic coaches, 
						I thought it only fitting to do an analysis of what makes a good player.  Being a coach/player for many years and having 
						had the pleasure of working with some very talented players I obviously had my own opinions of what matters in players.  
						But I was always curios about the types of attributes that made up top players.  I found a data set on Kaggle that had 
						the attributes of many players.  Now these are ratings for the game EA Sports Fifa, but they are consider accurate ratings.</P>

						<P>What I am going to review is basic skills.  These are: Crossing, Finishing, Short Passing, Long Passing, Volleys, Dribbling, and Ball Control.
						I have used Python to get and clean the data, then build json files to display here.<br>
						The data source is from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer<br>
						I have loaded the Python file and all data files except the database to github - https://github.com/debreceni/FE550_Python</P>
						<h3>Questions</H3>
						<UL><LI>Are there certain attributes that are more common in the top end players vs bottom? (approx 10,000 players analyzed)
						<LI>In the top 100 ranked players in the world, how do the skills break down?
						<LI>Are there certain skills that more desired by position?
						<LI>What should coaches focus on when developing players?
						<UL>
					
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<Div>What are the attributes and ratings of players.  Take a look below at the overall ratings based upon players inside of deciles.</div>

						<P>From the above graphs it is very clear that there are attributes that are desirable at every level player.  Looking at the relative
						values for each skill you can easily see this.  There are attributes like Ball Control and short passing that are highly desired for every player of every decile.
						I found it interesting that Volleys seems to be a skill with higher desirability than finishing.  I mean who doesn't love a great goal!!  But this really shows that
						while a very important part of the game, it is not the most desired attribute.  If a player can't control a pass than there will be very few opportunities to score.  
						This could also be skewed a bit in that there are typically only a few players on the field whose primary role is finishing.  
						Something else to note is how for the first decile the range between the most desired and least desired skills is very low.  This may change when only look at the top 100 players.
						When we look at position specific items	lets see if this changes for Forwards.
						</P>
						<P>This analysis looks at approximately 10k players.  Lets see if there is a notable difference in the top 100 players.</p>

						<h3>Top 100 players</h3>
					
						<div id="topplayerschart"></div>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-5" style="margin-left:75px; margin-top:50px;">
						
						<div class="h3">Chart Analysis</div>
						<p>The chart on the left looks at both the average score in each of the player attributes being analyzed, the max score for each attribute and the skill importance.
						From the data it appears that the top 3 things that help a players rating are: Ball Control, Short Passing and Dribbling.  These attributes are all
						rated higher by almost 5%, meaning players in this group are better at those items.  However when you look at the skill importance on average for the top 100 
						players Crossing is more desirable than dribbling.
						This means while on average your best players have better dribbling skills than crossing, as a whole the crossing skill is considered more important to the score as a whole.
						Notice as well the decrease in long passing as an important skill.  This is because higher level teams typically posess with short combination style play.
						On average the other skills listed all seem to be in-line with each other.  Not much variance there.  and the importance of all the skills is rather high for this group.
						 </p>
						</div>
					
					
				</div>
				<div class="row" >
					<div class="col-sm-12">
						Now lets look at similar stats but broken down by the players positions as well.  Lets see if there is any clear difference's like one would expect.
						ie a Forward should have better finishing scores and a Defender may have higher long passing scores.

						<p>The above graphs certainly confirm some items that are common sense.  For instance Finishing for a forward is one of the higher skills needed vs it is the least valued skill in a defender.
						I did find it a bit suprising to see that as we move down in the lower deciles that the Forwards seem to flatten out a bit more for the required skills.  This is most likely due to the fact 
						that these players often play for teams that are not as good and their responsibilities extend beyond the role of the forward.<br>
						Midfielders seem to have the most level set of values, meaning they have to be more of a "Jack of all trades" type player.  This speaks to the role of a midfielder that involves being part of the 
						attack as well as being responsible for defending.  Midfielders I think are highly underrated as players.  They can make or break a game and as such should be getting higher overall ratings than they do.
						This chart clearly shows that midfielders have to do well in every skill.
						<br>For defenders the 3 skills that stand out are Ball Control, Short passing and Long Passing.  In contrary to Long Passing was not as desired, here it shows that for the lower level teams it is certainly a requirement.
						Note that Decile 1 players seem to flatten out around Short, Long Passing and Crossing.  This again goes to the type of play at the top levels.  
						Defenders often get involved in the attack, requiring them to have these additional skills.</p>
						<p>Now lets see how the scores for the top 100 players stack up by position.<p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-sm-4">
						<h4 class="text-center">Forwards</H4>
						<div id="postopplayersFWD"></div>
						<p class="text-center" style="margin-left:50px">The final analysis for the top 100 players I found insightful. No suprise again that Forwards need to finish.  As the average rating for these players shows, they are required to have 
						multiple skills at a high level.  What was unexpected was the value placed relative to other skills.  Short passing for the forwards was something I expected to be in higher demand.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-4 ">
						<h4 class="text-center">Midfielders</H4>
						<div id="postopplayersMID"></div>
						<p class="text-center" style="margin-left:50px">Midfielders again show that they must be a "Jack of all Trades" with all of their scores being fairly close to each other.  I did find the desirability of volleys and finishing of note.
						This means to me while the other skills are required, these 2 are highly desired.  This may go to the fact that the midfielders on higher level teams really are encouraged to be part of the attack.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-4 ">
						<h4 class="text-center">Defenders</H4>
						<div id="postopplayersDEF"></div>
						<p class="text-center" style="margin-left:50px">Defenders were more of the flat line for skills this time.  I believe that is because high level teams require their defenders to do more than just defend.  They almost take on roles of midfielders
						in the modern game.  Again the desirability of Volleys and Finishing was interesting to see, despite that being something with a very low score over all.</P>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row" >
					<div class="col-sm-12">
						<h4>Conclusion</h4>
						<p>The information above helped give me some insight into the skills of the better players but also to the value of other skills in relation to the package as a whole.  These additional skills will make
						players more desirable at all levels of play.  As a coach I should clearly focus on Short passing, Ball Control and Dribbling.  These items on all levels seem to have higher value than others.  
						If you want to develop a player into something more, these must haves will make or break them.  If you truely want to break into the top 100 though, you need to mast some of these more desirable skills such
						as volleys.</p>
