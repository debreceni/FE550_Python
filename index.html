				<H1>Attributes of a Soccer Player</H1>
				<H3>Dave Debreceni</H3>
				<P>Since I was taking my son to soccer camp this week to be reviewed by various international and domestic coaches, 
				I thought it only fitting to do an analysis of what makes a good player.  Being a coach/player for many years and having 
				had the pleasure of working with some very talented players I obviously had my own opinions of what matters in players.  
				But I was always curios about the types of attributes that made up top players.  I found a data set on Kaggle that had 
				the attributes of many players.  Now these are ratings for the game EA Sports Fifa, but they are consider accurate ratings.</P>

				<P>What I am going to review is basic skills.  These are: Crossing, Finishing, Short Passing, Long Passing, Volleys, Dribbling, and Ball Control.
				I have used Python to get and clean the data, then build json files to display here.</P>
				<h3>Questions</H3>
				<UL><LI>Are there certain attributes that are more common in the top end players vs bottom? (approx 10,000 players analyzed)
				<LI>In the top 100 ranked players in the world, how do the skills break down?
				<LI>Are there certain skills that more desired by position?
				<LI>What should coaches focus on when developing players?
				<UL>

				
				<br>
				<br>
				<Div>What are the attributes and ratings of players.  Take a look below at the overall ratings based upon players inside of deciles.</div>

						<P>From the above graphs it is very clear that there are attributes that are desirable at every level player.  Looking at the relative
						values for each skill you can easily see this.  There are attributes like Ball Control and short passing that are highly desired for every player of every decile.
						I found it interesting that Volleys seems to be a skill with higher desirability than finishing.  I mean who doesn't love a great goal!!  But this really shows that
						while a very important part of the game, it is not the most desired attribute.  If a player can't control a pass than there will be very few opportunities to score.  
						This could also be skewed a bit in that there are typically only a few players on the field whose primary role is finishing.  When we look at position specific items
						lets see if this changes for Forwards.
						</P>
						<P>This analysis looks at approximately 10k players.  Lets see if there is a notable difference in the top 100 players.</p>

						<span class="vcenter">The chart on the left looks at both the average score in each of the player attributes being analyzed as well as the max score for each attribute.
						From the data it appears that the top 3 things that help a players rating are: Ball Control, Short Passing and Dribbling.  These attributes are all
						rated higher by almost 5%.  When you consider the fact that this is an average score that is pretty significant.  The other skills listed all seem to be in-line
						with each other.  Not much variance there.  One thing I found interesting is the lowest ranked score was for Crossing this time.  Not Volleys as it was before in the 
						larger sample set.  </span>
